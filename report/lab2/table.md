Creating a truth table and Karnaugh map (K-map) for the system you described involves analyzing how the system's output depends on the combination of three signals: FETCH, STORE, and LDSBR, with the condition that only one of these signals is active at any time to prevent collisions. Additionally, the EQUAL state from the comparator indicates when the address from the counter matches the target address (SAR), allowing data storage operations to proceed.

Let's break down the steps:

### 1. Define Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** FETCH, STORE, LDSBR, EQUAL
- **Output:** Let's denote the output operation as "Action," which represents what the system should do based on the input conditions (e.g., no operation, store data, fetch data, load data into shift registers).

### 2. Construct the Truth Table

Given the condition that only one signal (FETCH, STORE, LDSBR) is active at any time, and considering the EQUAL signal:

| FETCH | STORE | LDSBR | EQUAL | Action  | S1S0           |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |----- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     | No operation       | 00|
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 1     | No operation       | 00|
| 1     | 0     | 0     | 0     | No operation       | 00|
| 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | Fetch data         |01|
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | No operation       |00|
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | Store data         |00|
| 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     | No operation       |10|
| 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | Load data into SBR |01|

In this table, "Action" is simplified to illustrate what operation the system performs based on the inputs. The actual implementation could have different outputs or signals to control the data path in your circuit.

### 3. Create the Karnaugh Map (K-map)

For simplicity, let's create a K-map for a single output function that represents whether any operation (fetch, store, or load) should occur, based on the EQUAL signal being active. We'll assume a binary representation of actions for illustrative purposes.

Since we have four input variables, our K-map will be a 4x4 grid, but for simplicity and relevance to your system's operation mode (given that only one control signal is active when EQUAL is high), we'll focus on the relevant minterms.

#### K-map Simplification

Given the constraints and focusing on the EQUAL being high:

- When EQUAL=1 and FETCH=1, we perform a fetch operation.
- When EQUAL=1 and STORE=1, we store data.
- When EQUAL=1 and LDSBR=1, we load data into SBR.

The K-map can be used to simplify the logic expression for each action. However, since each action is triggered by a unique signal and the EQUAL signal, the simplification might directly reflect the conditions stated in the truth table.

For detailed K-map entries and simplification, you would list all the conditions where an action occurs as '1' and the rest as '0'. Each cell in the K-map represents a combination of the inputs FETCH, STORE, LDSBR, and EQUAL. You fill in '1' where the corresponding action takes place and '0' otherwise. Due to the mutual exclusivity and the dependency on the EQUAL signal, the logic expressions for actions could directly map from the conditions without further simplification needed.

CD  | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 
AB  +----+----+----+----+----
00  |  0 |  0 |  X |  0 |   
01  |  0 |  1 |  X |  1 |   
11  |  X |  X |  X |  X |  
10  |  0 |  1 |  X |  1 |   


### Conclusion

For systems with complex logic and multiple inputs like yours, truth tables and K-maps serve as foundational tools for designing and simplifying the control logic. The specific actions (fetch, store, load) are controlled by the unique conditions of the input signals, particularly the EQUAL signal indicating when the operation is valid. This approach helps ensure that the digital system behaves predictably and efficiently, executing the correct operation based on the current state of its inputs.
