## lab7.sv Top-Level Module

The `lab7` module serves as the top-level integration of the Nios II system and the FPGA fabric, ensuring that all components in the digital system interact seamlessly.

### Inputs
- `CLOCK_50`: The 50 MHz system clock input.
- `KEY [3:0]`: A 4-bit input representing the push-buttons on the board.

### Outputs
- `LEDG [7:0]`: An 8-bit output to the green LEDs on the board.
- `DRAM_*`: Various outputs to control the DRAM, including address lines, bank address, command lines, data bus, and clock.

### Bidirectional
- `DRAM_DQ [31:0]`: A 32-bit bidirectional data bus for the DRAM.

### Description
This module instantiates the `lab7_soc` module and wires up the external I/O, clock, and reset signals to the internal components. The `accmu_export` input is connected to the negation of `KEY[3]`, allowing for active-low button press detection. The `clk_clk` input is driven by the `CLOCK_50` signal, supplying the system clock to the SoC. The `reset_reset_n` and `reset_wire_export` inputs are connected to `KEY[0]` and the negation of `KEY[2]` respectively, to handle system and peripheral resets. The LED output `led_wire_export` and the switch input `switch_export` are wired directly to the `LEDG` output and `SW` input ports for user interaction. All DRAM-related signals are connected to their respective outputs, facilitating memory operations for the system.

This configuration of `lab7` ensures that the FPGA's pins are appropriately mapped to the internal logic of the SoC, effectively creating the hardware platform on which the software will run.

### Additional Notes
- It is crucial that the port names in this top-level module match the interface definitions in `lab7_soc.v`.
- Additional FPGA fabric modules may be instantiated as needed to extend the functionality of the digital system.





## lab7_soc.v Module

The `lab7_soc` module acts as the central hub for interfacing and controlling the various components within the Lab 7 system-on-chip (SoC). 

### Inputs
- `accmu_export`: Input signal for the accumulator.
- `clk_clk`: System clock input.
- `reset_reset_n`: Active-low reset signal for the entire SoC.
- `reset_wire_export`: Additional reset signal, possibly connected to an external reset button.
- `switch_export`: Input signal from the user switches.

### Outputs
- `led_wire_export`: Output signal to the green LEDs used to display binary values.
- `sdram_clk_clk`: SDRAM clock output.
- `sdram_wire_*`: Multiple SDRAM interface signals including address, bank address, command signals, and data bus.

### Description
This module serves as the processing unit of the system, utilizing a Nios II processor to send data and instructions across the SoC. The software application is executed on this processor. The on-chip SDRAM is interfaced to store data generated by the CPU, and the module also handles user input from switches and displays data on LEDs.
