The DE2 memory management is a bit problematic and misleading. I would recommend you watch carefully on each submodule in the BlackBoard notation. 

Here is the function of each file in the folder:
- Control Panel, the buggy tool to import LC3 program into the DE2 board hardware memory. 
- bin32.zip, uzsed to fix an import error while using Control Panel
- SD CARD.sof & DE2_115.sof: SD card import method, we didn't use it.
- Test_Programs_image.ram, the LC3 program written by the ECE385 Team, it includes a series of unit test for submodule check.
- Data Path Control Signal.pdf, reference for the datapath.sv writing

- testbench_week1.sv & testbench_week2.sv: simulation wave test program for two weeks seperately

- Test Programs.pdf: How to test the LC3 program with expected outcome
