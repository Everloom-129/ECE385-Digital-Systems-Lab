# C code in our final project

1. Our game is developed based on Lab8, with a ready keyboard detector

2. DIrectory Tetris_C/ includes our effert on C programming for the game, but when we try to render the logic from C to SV, we found the PIO limit the input size, so we choose to realize our functionality in SV.
